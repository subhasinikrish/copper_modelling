# copper_modelling
Project Title: Industrail Copper Modelling
Objective:
      The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-    consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.
      
Steps followed:
      Explored skewness and outliers in the dataset.
      Transformed the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
      Developped ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’.
      Developed ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.
      Created a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost)

Technologies Used:
      Python scripting,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Data Preprocessing,EDA, Streamlit

Domain:
      Manufacturing
